Simple REST Client for Opera 12
=======
Simple REST Client is an extension for Opera 12 or 11 to help construct custom
HTTP requests to directly test your web services.

FEATURES
=======
* Construct custom HTTP requests to directly test your web services.
* Validates XML (well-formedness), JSON and Javascript.
* Formats and highlights JSON data (JsonViewer by s-a-s-h)
* Formats and highlights XML data (XMLDisplay by Lev Muchnik)
* Preview HTML
  Note: not fully functional. The browser's parser will not know the
  base URL, so loading resources with relative paths does not always
  work.
